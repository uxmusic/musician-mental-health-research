Independent research on professional musicians' mental health, wellbeing, and labor conditions.

# Musician Mental Health & Wellbeing Research

This repository serves as the public home for my independent research on professional musicians’ mental health, wellbeing, and working conditions.

## Research Focus
My work examines the psychological, social, and occupational factors shaping the lives of working musicians, with a particular interest in:
- Burnout and emotional regulation
- Economic precarity and labor conditions
- Gender, identity, and power in music communities
- Mental health stigma and access to care

## Current Status
- Primary dataset collected through prior graduate research
- Quantitative and qualitative analyses in revision for journal submission
- Public datasets are not currently available due to original ethical consent restrictions

## Data Ethics
All research involving human participants follows:
- De-identification standards
- Institutional ethics approvals where applicable
- Informed consent protections

Raw participant data are not publicly shared unless explicitly permitted by original consent.

## Future Work
Planned directions include:
- New survey-based studies with open-data consent
- Cross-national comparisons of musician wellbeing
- Public-facing visualizations and open methods documentation
